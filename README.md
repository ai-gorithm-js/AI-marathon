# Introduction

Harnessing the power computation, from sand to silicon to transistors to ALUs to hertz, or i like to call heartbeat of the computer; named after [Dr Herinrich Rudolf Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz).

Push the limits of gaming, or in this case upgrading a skill level by performing a sequential action at maximum efficiency.


# Goals

A purely mathematical approach to solve a solution 300%-3000%-30000% the rate of speed of human capacity, will be used in the programming projects to be followed with the actual implemention and realization of an intelligence created artificially.
